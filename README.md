SpaceApps 2015 GoSat Project Prop
"Gosat is a multifunctional microsatelite that aspires to approach space misions to everyone" 
It's not interesting to send a satellite only to take pictures, this is the reason why we created GoSat. 
GoSat allows us to not only take pictures, but to do valuable scientific research. Moreover based on the UDP, 
we have developed an innovative docking system which allows GoSat to be refueled and wirelessly recharged while 
transfering data with the spacecraft.
